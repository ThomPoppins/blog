      Umami's YouTube channel is a captivating journey into creativity, mainly
      featuring the ongoing "Interface" series. The animations are visually
      stunning, with a unique style using 15 frames per second, a limited color
      palette, and a lower resolution for a distinct feel. The music plays a
      significant role, guiding the stories with a mesmerizing harmony.
    </p>

    <p>
      The channel offers a multisensory experience, u m a m i's content goes
      beyond visuals, exploring deep themes like coping mechanisms, death,
      grief, and personal struggles in the "Interface" series.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the artistic process remains mysterious, u m a m i's animations
      reflect the artist's mastery. The channel is not just a content platform
      but a portal into the mind of a creative genius. Each video, with its
      mesmerizing visuals, enchanting soundtrack, and profound narratives,

    <h3>Read this text below AFTER watching the Interface movie:</h3>

    <p>
      Interface is a web series by Umami that revolves around a significant
      event known as the Philadelphia Experiment, which took place in 1943.
      During this experiment, a military vessel tested an experimental stealth
      cloaking technology, likely quantum mechanical in nature. However, the
      device malfunctioned, leading to unintended consequences for both the crew
      and the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      The malfunction triggered an event revealing a new force called "cerebral
      electricity." This force is essentially the physical energy of
      consciousness, generated by living things and released when they die. As a
      result of the experiment, most of the crew was fused with the ship, and
      only three survivors emerged: Henryk Niebieski, Percy (Mischief), and
      Joseph Greetings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Percy, technically dying in his original human form, managed to "regain
      his physicality" and became a new form of entity composed of cerebral
      electricity, known as Mischief. This incident led to the manifestation of
      spectral cerebral entities worldwide, plaguing the world with ghosts and
      monsters, and altering the skies and seas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Joseph Greetings, one of the survivors, founded the Greetings robotics
      corporation to study cerebral electricity. They created KAMI, a machine
      designed to hunt cerebral entities, harvest their cerebral electricity,
      and catalogue it. The collected data was then uploaded to a flying
      database called the mechanical saccorhytus. Humanity used technology to
      harness this new force, driving back the spectral entities, though some
      found ways to integrate and hide within cities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Henryk, left in an odd state between life and death, became immortal and
      lost in time. The plot involves the intertwined lives of Henryk, Mischief,
      and Greetings, exploring their pasts and personal connections. Greetings
      envisions merging all cerebral electricity into a single form, possibly to
      ascend to godhood or save lost minds. He builds the vessel, KAMI, to
      collect and absorb cerebral electricity, eventually sacrificing himself to
      create a homunculus god.
    </p>

    <p>
      The story explores the consequences of purging the world of perceived
      monsters, only to create a greater threat. Mischief ultimately sacrifices
      himself to sabotage the homunculus god, leaving the outcome ambiguous. The
      series concludes with the world returning to a semblance of normalcy but
      forever changed.
